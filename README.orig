The three numbers after load average -  1.00, 1.01, 0.98 - represent the 1-, 5-, and 15-minute load averages on the machine. A system load average is equal to the average number of processes in a runnable or uninterruptible state. Runnable processes are either currently using the CPU or waiting to <span class="k">do</span> so, and uninterruptible processes are waiting <span class="k">for</span> I/O.</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="medium-linux-questions">[[⬆]]Medium Linux Questions:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>What do the following commands do and how would you use them?</li>
  <li><code>tee</code></li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">tee - <span class="nb">read </span>from standard input and write to standard output and files
For example you can use this <span class="nb">command </span>like this:
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;deb http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian binary/&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span> sudo  tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list</code></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>awk</code></li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">The awk is most useful when handling text files that are formatted in a predictable way. For instance, it is excellent at parsing and manipulating tabular data. It operates on a line-by-line basis and iterates through the entire file.
The awk syntax looks like this:
awk <span class="s1">&#39;/search_pattern/ { action_to_take_on_matches; another_action; }&#39;</span> file_to_parse

For example you can use this <span class="nb">command </span>like this:
<span class="nv">$ </span>awk <span class="s1">&#39;{print}&#39;</span> /etc/fstab</code></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>tr</code></li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">We can use tr <span class="k">for</span> translating, or deleting, or squeezing repeated characters.
It will <span class="nb">read </span>from STDIN and write to STDOUT.

For example you can use this <span class="nb">command </span>like this:
<span class="nv">$ </span>tr a-z A-Z
<span class="nv">$ </span>tr <span class="s1">&#39;()&#39;</span> <span class="s1">&#39;{}&#39;</span></code></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>cut</code></li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">The <span class="nb">command </span>cut is used <span class="k">for</span> text processing.
We can use this <span class="nb">command </span>to extract portion of text from a file by selecting columns.
cut OPTION... <span class="o">[</span>FILE<span class="o">]</span>...

For example you can use this <span class="nb">command </span>like this:
The example displays only the first field of each lines from /etc/passwd file using the field delimiter : <span class="o">(</span>colon<span class="o">)</span>. In this <span class="k">case</span>, the 1st field is the username.
<span class="nv">$ </span>cut -d <span class="s1">&#39;:&#39;</span> -f <span class="m">1</span> &lt; /etc/passwd</code></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>tac</code></li>

1
2
3

<span class="nv">$ </span>tac ok
3
2
1</code></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>curl</code></li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">Curl is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the supported protocols <span class="o">(</span>DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP<span class="o">)</span>.  The <span class="nb">command </span>is designed to work without user interaction.
For example you can use this <span class="nb">command </span>like this:
<span class="nv">$ </span>curl https://example.com</code></pre></div>

<ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">Swap is a special <span class="nb">type </span>of memory.
Swap space in Linux is used when the amount of physical memory <span class="o">(</span>RAM<span class="o">)</span> is full. If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space. While swap space can <span class="nb">help </span>machines with a small amount of RAM, it should not be considered a replacement <span class="k">for</span> more RAM. Swap space is located on hard drives, which have a slower access <span class="nb">time </span>than physical memory.
Swapping is a useful technique that enables a computer to execute programs and manipulate data files larger than main memory. The operating system copies as much data as possible into main memory, and leaves the rest on the disk. When the operating system needs data from the disk, it exchanges a portion of data <span class="o">(</span>called a page or segment<span class="o">)</span> in main memory with a portion of data on the disk.</code></pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">Runlevel is a mode of operation in OS, and a runlevel represents the different system state of a Linux system.

When a service starts, it will try to start all the services that are associated with that runlevel.

In general, when a computer enters runlevel 0, the system shuts down all running processes, unmounts all file systems, and powers off.

When it enters runlevel 6, it reboots.

The intermediate runlevels <span class="o">(</span>1-5<span class="o">)</span> differ in terms of which drives are mounted, and which network services are started. Default runlevels are typically 3, 4, or 5.

Runlevel <span class="m">1</span> is reserved <span class="k">for</span> single-user mode-a state where only a single user can log in to the system. Generally, few processes are started in single-user mode, so it is a very useful runlevel <span class="k">for</span> diagnostics when a system won<span class="s1">&#39;t fully boot.

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">A tunnel is a mechanism used to ship a foreign protocol across a network that normally wouldn<span class="s1">&#39;t support it. Tunneling protocols allow you to use, for example, IP to send another protocol in the &quot;data&quot; portion of the IP datagram. Most tunneling protocols operate at layer 4, which means they are implemented as a protocol that replaces something like TCP or UDP.</span>

<span class="s1">You can forward a port from your computer to a remote computer, which has the result of tunneling your data over SSH in the process, making it secure. This may not seem useful, after all, why would I want a port on my computer being forwarded to another computer? The answer lies within some clarification. The port forwarding function of SSH works by first listening on a local socket for a connection. When a connection is made, SSH will forward the entire connection onto the remote host and portable.</span>

<span class="s1">For example: &#39;</span>ssh -L80:workserver.com:80 user@workdesktop.com<span class="err">&#39;</span>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">The first step of the boot process is the BIOS <span class="o">(</span>Basic Input Output System<span class="o">)</span>.

The BIOS initializes hardware, including detecting hard drives, USB disks, CD-ROMs, network cards, and any other hardware.

The BIOS will <span class="k">then</span> go step-by-step through each boot device based on the boot device order it is configured to follow <span class="k">until</span> it finds one it can successfully boot from. In the <span class="k">case</span> of a Linux server, that usually means reading the MBR <span class="o">(</span>master boot record: the first <span class="m">512</span> bytes on a hard drive<span class="o">)</span> and loading and executing the boot code inside the MBR to start the boot process.

After the BIOS initializes the hardware and finds the first device to boot, the boot loader takes over. The following list shows the boot loader depending on the device from a boot starts:

GRUB : boot from a hard drive
syslinux : boot from a USB
isolinux : boot from a CD-ROM
pxelinux : boot from a network

Once we <span class="k">select</span> a particular kernel in GRUB, GRUB will load the Linux kernel into RAM and execute it.

Usually GRUB will also load an initrd <span class="o">(</span>initial RAM disk<span class="o">)</span> along with the kernel. initrd <span class="o">(</span>initial RAM disk<span class="o">)</span> has some crucial configuration files, kernel modules, and programs that the kernel needs in order to find and mount the real root file system.

The final step is to execute the /sbin/init program, which takes over the rest of the boot process.

The /sbin/init program is the parent process of every program running on the system. This process always has a PID of <span class="m">1</span> and is responsible <span class="k">for</span> starting the rest of the processes that make up a running Linux system.

Here is the list of how we initialize a NIX OS:

System V init such as runlevels and /etc/rc?.d directories - the init process reads a configuration file called /etc/inittab to discover its default runlevel. It <span class="k">then</span> enters that runlevel and starts processes that have been configured to run at that runlevel. Linux distros: Debian <span class="m">6</span> and earlier<span class="se">\U</span>buntu 9.04 and earlier<span class="se">\C</span>entOS <span class="m">5</span> and earlier

Upstart - Upstart was designed not only to address some of the shortcomings of the System V init process, but also to provide a more robust system <span class="k">for</span> managing services.
One main feature of Upstart is that it is event-driven. Upstart constantly monitors the system <span class="k">for</span> certain events to occur, and when they <span class="k">do</span>, Upstart can be configured to take action based on those events.
Upstart scripts reside in /etc/init. Linux distros: Ubuntu 9.10 to Ubuntu 14.10, including Ubuntu 14.04
CentOS 6

systemd is the init system <span class="k">for</span> the most recent linux distros: Debian <span class="m">7</span> and Debian 8<span class="se">\U</span>buntu 15.04<span class="se">\C</span>entOS 7</code></pre></div>

- easier to implement <span class="o">(</span>writing good compilers is very hard!!<span class="o">)</span>
- no need to run a compilation stage: can execute code directly <span class="s2">&quot;on the fly&quot;</span>
- being more portable.

Script program have the disadvantages of:
- much slow than compiled program
- <span class="nb">source </span>code is open

Compiled program have the advantages of:
- faster performance by directly using the native code of the target machine
- opportunity to apply quite powerful optimisations during the compile stage
- hides the <span class="nb">source </span>code from the end user

Compiled program have the disadvantages of:
- slow to develop <span class="o">(</span>edit, compile, link and run. The compile/link steps could take serious <span class="nb">time</span><span class="o">)</span>.
- to execute you need to compile a different executable <span class="k">for</span> each <span class="nb">type </span>of processor and/or platform that you want your program to run on</code></pre></div>

Every task that can be <span class="k">done</span> by a machine should be.
Automation gives you the <span class="nb">time </span>to focus.
Through testing, you can be sure that the most important steps your customers will take through your system are working, regardless of the changes you make.
This gives you the confidence to experiment, implement new features, and ship updates quickly.</code></pre></div>
